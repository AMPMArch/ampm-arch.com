# AMPM Architecture & Design — minimal site (v4)

Changes requested:
- Home background photo (beachfront modern home) stored locally as /assets/hero.jpg
- Work page: smaller thumbnails that open full-size in a lightbox modal
- Font: using Inter (Google Fonts) as a free, close alternative to GT America.

About GT America:
- GT America is a licensed font. If you own it, you can self-host webfont files in /assets/fonts and replace the @import with @font-face rules.

Deploy:
- Upload all files to your GitHub repo root (not inside a folder)
- GitHub Pages: Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → main / root
